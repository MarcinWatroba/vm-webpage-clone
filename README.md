# vm-webpage-clone
I created this webpage based on the provided prototype.

The webpage is written in pure HTML5 CSS3 and JavaScript/jQuery without use of any frameworks. It should work on all modern PC/mobile browsers. It can be noted that I did not include any vendor-prefixed properties in the CSS file for older browser support. However, these properties could be quickly added using a CSS processor such as SASS.

Although navbar was not a requirement in the given task, I added it with some functionality as I am still learning web development myself, and this task is also a chance to test my skills.

Webpage interactivity:

- Responsiveness when changing screen size.
- Navbar elements are in a dropdown menu on smaller screens.
- New Vehicles and Nearly New/Used Vehicles tabs on navbar display dropdowns when cursor hovers over them.
- Navigation chevron and radio buttons within these dropdowns can be used to view next/prev elements.
- Sub-sections for car dimensions, layouts, colours, and interior trims can be viewed individually with the use of buttons.
- Car colour and material type can be changed within the "Colour" sub-section
- Different types of interior trim can be selected in the "Interior Trim" sub-section.
- Gallery images can be browsed with the use of left and right chevron buttons, index of current image is displayed at the bottom of the gallery section.
